	  I was born and raised in the Republic of Moldova.
	  In 2010, I enrolled in the Faculty of Radioelectronic and Telecommunication at the Technical University of Moldova.
      In 2013, I immigrated to the United States. In the spring of 2018, I began my studies at Borough of Manhattan Community College. I successfully completed my associate's degree in Computer Science with honors in 2021. During the summer, I continued my education at Hunter College, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am expected to graduate in the fall of 2023.
      I have a strong interest in studying Cybersecurity. In the spring of 2023, I obtained a Cybersecurity certification from CodePath.
	  Upon graduating from college, I plan to further specialize in this field and continue my professional growth in the Cybersecurity domain.
