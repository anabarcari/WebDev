	   Serbian-American engineer and physicist <b>Nikola Tesla (1856-1943)</b>
	     made dozens of breakthroughs in the production, transmission and 
		 application of electric power. He invented the first alternating
		 current (AC) motor and developed AC generation and transmission technology.
		 Though he was famous and respected, he was never able to translate his copious
		 inventions into long-term financial successâ€”unlike his early employer and chief rival, Thomas Edison.

	<h2 style="font-size:30px;">Here are some interesting facts about Nikola Tesla:</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Wireless Power Transmission: Tesla envisioned a world where power could be transmitted wirelessly. 
	    He conducted experiments on wireless power transmission and even proposed building a wireless transmission tower known as the Wardenclyffe Tower.
	    Although the project was never fully realized, his ideas laid the foundation for future wireless technologies.</li>
	<li>Niagara Falls Power: Tesla played a crucial role in the design and implementation of the first hydroelectric
	    power plant at Niagara Falls. He successfully demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of AC power transmission by transmitting 
	    electricity over long distances, which helped to establish AC as the prevailing electrical system.</li>
	<li>Contributions to X-ray Technology: Tesla made significant contributions to the development of X-ray technology.
     	He discovered X-rays independently of Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen and conducted experiments to capture X-ray images.</li>
